# simple-typescript-template

A no bells and whistles template to setup a TypeScript project. Perfect for beginners just learning TS.

## Quick Start

Click on the "Use this template" button located above.
From that dropdown, select "Create a new repository" and give your new repo whatever name you want.

Once your new repo is created, clone it down and run `npm install` from within the project directory.

Running a TS file is similar to running a JS file with `Node`, with a minor difference:

### Two Ways to Run Your TS Files

#### Automatically (Recommended)

To run your code automatically on save, run `npm run dev`.

This will run any code in the `index.ts` file located in the `src` directory.

_When you first start learning TypeScript, this allows you to simply write your code in that `index.ts` and see the results each time you save the file._

#### Manually

For running any TS file, just run `npx ts-node path/to/file.ts` to run the file.
